	{
		name: "the Golgari Swarm",
		image: "images/golgari.jpg",
		description: "The Golgari Swarm is the embodiment and amalgamation of life and death. The guild believes that life and death are both natural and are essential to, and as essential as, one another, with life and death being natural elements of a cycle with no intermediary break. Growth, and thus power, however slowly but ruthlessly and inevitably, are key to the Swarm. As a consequence of their necromantic magic, the Golgari are the largest Ravnican guild."
	},
	{
		name: "the Gruul Clans",
		image: "images/gruul.jpg",
		description: "The Gruul are decentralized, lacking any sort of real leadership. Now the guild is nothing but a loose affiliation of clans. They have been exploited and ignored. They take any reason to cause chaos, any reason to destroy a symbol of civilization."
	},
	{
		name: "the Azorius Senate",
		image: "images/azorius.jpg",
		description: "Believing their legislation to be the singular force that prevents Ravnica from descending into chaos, the Azorius Senate mediates and regulates the activities of all of the other guilds and of the plane despite their numerous decrees being ignored. The Azorius Senate are characterized as being aloof, bureaucratic, excessively formalistic, and fastidious, spending hours upon hours with legal documents and ensuring action, if any should occur, stringently adheres to protocol."
	},
	{
		name: "the Boros Legion",
		image: "images/boros.jpg",
		description: "Founded by parun Razia, a militant flaming-sword-wielding archangel capable of using flame and light magic who fervently and firmly believes in harmonious coexistence on Ravnica, even if lives are lost and blood is shed in achieving this, the Boros Legion functions as the righteous and zealous constabulary and standing army of Ravnica."
	},
	{
		name: "the Izzet League",
		image: "images/izzet.jpg",
		description: "The Izzet League are charged with attending to Ravnican civic works, including water supply systems, sewers, heating systems, boilers, and roadways. In addition to carrying out these functions, the Izzet members — obsessive, keen, and creative intellectuals, who often have short attention spans — are known to perform magical experiments, ever with reckless abandon and sometimes with spectacular but severe results. Unlike the other guilds, the Izzet do not strive for hegemony of the city and the plane of Ravnica or power at all. Instead, integral to the Izzet League, a guild of masters of both theoretical and applied science and spellcraft, is the passionate seeking of, and thirst for, knowledge. Combined with their drive for discovery and child-like curiosity, the brilliant but capricious and whimsical Izzet magewrights jump to and from ideas as they see fit, discarding old ideas for new ones that attract their attention. In this regard, they can be likened to ambivalent or benevolent mad and absent-minded scientists/professors."

	{
		name: "the Simic Combine",
		image: "images/simic.jpg",
		description: "The original purpose of the Simic Combine was to preserve the health of all Ravnican life-forms. They were devoted to the study of life, medicines, and biomancy."
	},
	{
		name: "the Orzhov Syndicate",
		image: "images/orzhov.jpg",
		description: "Their white flavor can be seen in that they have a strong sense of tradition and community, reflected by the fact that they still go through all of their ancient rituals and customs despite not truly worshipping any gods, and by that they hoard all their wealth to themselves but will gladly share with family members or close friends. Their black flavor can be seen in that they regularly deal with the dead, they never give to charity if they can help it, and continually violate the spirit of the law solely to meet their own ends."
	},
	{
		name: "House Dimir",
		image: "images/dimir.jpg",
		description: "House Dimir is a guild of secrecy, manipulation and underhanded deals, a shadowy organization operating behind the scenes to twist Ravnica to its own ends. The guild provides espionage, smuggling, burglary, counter-intelligence, assassination and other illegal services for the Ravnican populace. The guild is so secretive that even its own agents often do not know who they truly work for."
	},
	{
		name: "the Cult of Rakdos",
		image: "images/rakdos.jpg",
		description: "Like extreme utilitarians or hedonists, the Cult of Rakdos are a guild that places a premium on personal pleasure, or 'fun', even if it cruelly causes pain and suffering to others and themselves. Some of the crueler, more evil, and more sadistic members of the Cult directly and intentionally inflict pain on others."
	},
	{
		name: "the Selesnya Conclave",
		image: "images/selesnya.jpg",
		description: "Founded by parun Mat'Selesnya, a female humanoid elemental formed via the fusion of dryads, the Selesnya Conclave is a decentralized collective variably described as a 'selfless, nurturing, spiritual group' or a 'brainwashing nature cult', and involves itself in the establishment and maintenance of peace, life, and unity in Ravnica."
